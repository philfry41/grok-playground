Taylor adjusted her party dress as she entered the dimly lit bedroom, her heart racing with anticipation. Chris, Ashley, and Ryan were already there, each still dressed in their party clothes and looking at her with hungry eyes. "You look amazing," Chris said, his voice deep as he stepped forward in his casual shirt and jeans. Ashley smoothed her cocktail dress as she moved closer, her eyes dark with desire. "We've been waiting for you," she purred. Ryan, still in his party attire, poured them all drinks, his gaze never leaving Taylor's form. "Absolutely gorgeous," he said, handing her a glass. Taylor could feel the sexual tension building as Chris's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "Are you ready for what we have planned?" he asked, his breath warm against her ear. Ashley moved to her other side, her hand gently touching Taylor's arm. "Let's get comfortable," Ashley suggested, her fingers tracing Taylor's collarbone through the fabric of her dress. Ryan stepped closer, his hands joining the others as they began exploring Taylor's body through her party attire.
