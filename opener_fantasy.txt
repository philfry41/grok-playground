Aria adjusted her elven robes as she entered the mystical chamber, her pointed ears twitching with anticipation. Thorne, Gimli, Pip, and Zara were already there, each in their full fantasy attire and looking at her with hungry eyes. "You look absolutely enchanting," Thorne said, his deep orc voice rumbling as he stepped forward in his leather armor. Gimli smoothed his beard as he moved closer, his dwarven eyes dark with desire. "We've been waiting for you, lass," he purred. Pip, still in his rogue's leathers, poured them all magical drinks, his gaze never leaving Aria's elven form. "Absolutely stunning," he said, handing her a glowing crystal goblet. Zara, in her flowing mage robes, moved to Aria's side, her hand gently touching her arm. "Are you ready for what we have planned?" Zara asked, her voice low and mystical. Aria could feel the magical tension building as Thorne's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "Let's get comfortable," Gimli suggested, his calloused fingers tracing Aria's collarbone through the fabric of her robes. Pip stepped closer, his hands joining the others as they began exploring Aria's body through her elven attire.
