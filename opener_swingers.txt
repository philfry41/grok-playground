Michelle adjusted her elegant dress as she entered the luxurious hotel suite, her eyes widening at the sight before her. Robert, Jessica, and Michael were all there, each impeccably dressed and looking at her with unmistakable desire. "You look absolutely stunning," Robert said, his voice deep and inviting as he stepped forward in his tailored suit. Jessica smoothed her designer dress as she moved closer, her eyes dark with anticipation. "We've been waiting for you," she purred. Michael, still in his business attire, poured them all drinks, his eyes never leaving Michelle's form. "Absolutely breathtaking," he said, handing her a glass. Michelle could feel the sexual tension building as Robert's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "Are you ready for what we have planned?" he asked, his breath warm against her ear. Jessica's hand joined Robert's, both of them exploring Michelle's body through the fabric of her dress. "Let's get comfortable," Michael suggested, his voice rough with desire as he began unbuttoning his shirt.
