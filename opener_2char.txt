Emma adjusted her silk blouse as she sat across from him at the upscale restaurant. The dim lighting cast shadows across his handsome face, and she couldn't help but notice how his tailored suit emphasized his broad shoulders. "This place is beautiful," she said, her fingers tracing the stem of her wine glass. His eyes never left hers as he leaned forward slightly. "Not as beautiful as you," he replied, his voice low and intimate. Emma felt a flush spread across her chest as his hand moved across the table, his fingers brushing against hers. The contact sent a jolt of electricity through her, and she found herself leaning in closer. "We shouldn't..." she whispered, but her voice betrayed her desire. His fingers traced higher up her arm, and she could feel her heart racing. The waiter was approaching, but neither of them cared. Emma's breath caught as she felt his hand slide up her thigh under the table, hidden by the white tablecloth.
