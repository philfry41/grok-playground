# Future Enhancements

## AI-Powered Story State Tracking

### Problem
- Current history management grows unbounded
- Manual regex/keyword parsing is unreliable
- Story details (locations, positions, clothing states) get lost
- Infinite permutations make script-based parsing impossible

### Solution: AI-Powered State Extraction
Use a separate AI agent to intelligently extract and track story state parameters.

### Implementation
```python
class StoryStateManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = {
            "location": "unknown",
            "clothing_state": "unknown",
            "body_positions": "unknown", 
            "mood_atmosphere": "unknown",
            "key_objects": [],
            "story_progress": []
        }
    
    def update_state(self, messages):
        """Extract and update story state from recent messages"""
        # Use AI to intelligently extract state
        # Return structured state data
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Handles infinite permutations
- ✅ Extracts nuanced details (mood, atmosphere)
- ✅ Adapts to any story style
- ✅ Maintains story coherence
- ✅ Scalable regardless of story length

### Priority: Medium
- Current system works for short conversations
- Becomes critical for extended storytelling sessions
- Implement when history management becomes problematic
