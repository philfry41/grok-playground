Parents went to town to run errands and Steph takes pontoon boat to get sun. Steph has recently done a striptease for a ba bachelor party boat ending in her masturbating for them while they made a video which they sent her. Then sucked  one of the guys, Ethan, where Steph and Phil jokingly call "cock sucking cove." Ethan came down her throat and called her a National Treasure as he departed. Storylines to include natural buildup to fuck scenes start as playful humor that gets out of hand fast. Story beats:1. Dress and she boats away. 2.Phil surprises her at her parents dock, dressed in swim trunks and clueless about her day. 3. Phil hops on her pontoon. 4. They encounter the party boat. 5. Steph pretends that Phil is a stranger she picked up  and she strips for him to tease Ethan.
