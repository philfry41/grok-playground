Amanda adjusted her party dress as she entered the luxurious hotel suite, her eyes widening at the sight before her. Brooke, Nicole, Vanessa, Tiffany, and Destiny were all there, each dressed in their bachelorette party attire and looking at her with unmistakable desire. "You look absolutely gorgeous," Brooke said, her voice inviting as she stepped forward in her cocktail dress. Nicole smoothed her party outfit as she moved closer, her eyes dark with anticipation. "We've been waiting for you," she purred. Vanessa, still in her elegant dress, poured them all drinks, her eyes never leaving Amanda's form. "Absolutely stunning," she said, handing her a glass. Tiffany, in her party attire, moved to Amanda's side, her hand gently touching her arm. "Are you ready for what we have planned?" Tiffany asked, her voice low and intimate. Destiny, the bride-to-be, stepped closer, her hand finding Amanda's waist. "Let's get comfortable," Destiny suggested, her fingers tracing Amanda's collarbone through the fabric of her dress. Amanda could feel the sexual tension building as all the women began exploring her body through their party attire.
