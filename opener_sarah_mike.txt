Sarah adjusted her professional blouse as she entered the empty conference room, her heart racing with anticipation. Mike was already there, still in his business suit, and looking at her with unmistakable desire. "You look beautiful," Mike said, his voice deep and commanding as he stepped forward. Sarah smoothed her pencil skirt as she moved closer, her eyes dark with need. "We've been flirting all day," she purred. Mike's hand found her waist, pulling her closer against the wall. "You've been teasing me," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. Sarah could feel the sexual tension building as Mike's other hand traced her collarbone through the fabric of her blouse. "I know," she whispered, her voice barely audible. Mike's fingers moved higher, exploring her body through her professional attire. "Let's get comfortable," he suggested, his voice rough with desire as he began unbuttoning his shirt.
