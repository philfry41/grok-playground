Emma smoothed her dress as she entered the dimly lit bedroom, her heart racing with anticipation. Alex and Jordan were already there, both fully dressed and looking at her with hungry eyes. "You look stunning," Alex said, his voice rough with desire as he stepped closer. Jordan moved to her other side, her hand gently touching Emma's arm. "We've been waiting for you," Jordan purred, her eyes dark with need. Emma could feel the heat building between them as Alex's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "Are you sure about this?" Emma asked, her voice barely a whisper. "More than sure," Jordan replied, her fingers tracing Emma's collarbone. Emma's breath caught as Alex's other hand joined Jordan's, both of them exploring her body through the fabric of her dress. "Let us take care of you," Alex murmured, his lips finding her neck. Emma's legs felt weak as their hands moved higher, and she knew there was no turning back.
