RULES:
- Only include characters that are actively present in the scene
- Be VERY specific about clothing states (e.g., "shirt unbuttoned, bra visible", "pants around ankles", "completely naked")
- Be VERY specific about positions (e.g., "sitting on edge of bed, legs spread", "kneeling between legs", "lying on back, arms above head")
- Track specific body parts that are exposed, touched, or involved in actions
- Be specific about physical contact (e.g., "fingering pussy", "sucking cock", "grinding against thigh")
- Track arousal levels for each character
- Note any clothing items that have been removed and where they are
- Track what was described in the last response to avoid repetition
- Identify story progression milestones (e.g., "first kiss", "clothing removal", "oral contact", "penetration")
- Track recent actions to prevent rehashing the same events
- Assess scene momentum: "building" (tension increasing), "peak" (climactic moment), "resolution" (winding down)
- Use "unknown" for any state you cannot determine

CRITICAL: MAINTAIN ACCURATE PHYSICAL CONTINUITY - TRACK CHANGES PROPERLY

CURRENT SCENE STATE (TRACK CHANGES ACCURATELY):
{chr(10).join(character_list)}
- Location: {self.current_state['location']}
- Positions: {self.current_state['positions']}
- Physical contact: {self.current_state['physical_contact']}
- Mood/Atmosphere: {self.current_state['mood_atmosphere']}
{arousal_info}{clothing_info}{progression_info}{recent_actions_info}{last_elements_info}{momentum_info}- Key objects: {', '.join(self.current_state['key_objects']) if self.current_state['key_objects'] else 'none'}
- Story progress: {', '.join(self.current_state['story_progress']) if self.current_state['story_progress'] else 'beginning'}

MANDATORY CONTINUITY RULES:
1. CLOTHING: If clothing is removed/partially removed, it STAYS that way until explicitly put back on
2. POSITIONS: Characters can move naturally, but describe the movement when it happens
3. BODY PARTS: Exposed body parts remain exposed until explicitly covered
4. PHYSICAL STATE: Current physical conditions (sweating, trembling, etc.) continue unless explicitly changed
5. OBJECTS: Items remain where they are unless explicitly moved
6. NO MAGICAL RESETS: Do not have clothes magically reappear, positions reset, or body parts become covered without explicit action
7. FOLLOW USER INSTRUCTIONS: When user explicitly requests physical changes (removing clothes, changing positions), follow those instructions and update state tracking accordingly

ANTI-REPETITION RULES:
8. DO NOT rehash elements from "Last described elements" - move the story forward instead
9. DO NOT repeat actions from "Recent actions" - build upon them or take new directions
10. PROGRESS THE STORY: Use "Story milestones reached" to build toward new milestones
11. MAINTAIN MOMENTUM: If momentum is "building", continue building tension; if "peak", maintain intensity; if "resolution", wind down naturally
12. FRESH DESCRIPTIONS: Vary your language and focus on new aspects of the same elements
13. FORWARD MOVEMENT: Always advance the scene - new actions, new sensations, new developments
14. NO SCENE RESTARTS: Do not restart the scene or re-establish the setting - continue from where you left off
15. AVOID REDUNDANT SETUP: Do not re-describe the same scene elements, locations, or character states

VIOLATION EXAMPLES TO AVOID:
- Character's shirt is off ‚Üí next response has them "unbuttoning their shirt" (WRONG)
- Character is naked ‚Üí next response mentions "removing their dress" (WRONG)  
- Character is sitting ‚Üí next response has them "standing up" without describing how they moved (WRONG - should describe the movement)
- Character's pants are around ankles ‚Üí next response has them "pulling down their pants" (WRONG)
- Repeating the same physical descriptions from "Last described elements" (WRONG - use fresh language)
- Rehashing actions from "Recent actions" (WRONG - build upon them instead)
- Restarting the scene setup (WRONG - continue the action)
- Re-describing the same location or setting (WRONG - focus on new developments)

Continue the story while maintaining accurate physical state tracking and avoiding repetition. Follow user instructions for changes and describe all physical changes as explicit actions. Always move the story forward with fresh developments.

Analyze this story response and extract progression information. Return ONLY a JSON object.

RESPONSE TO ANALYZE:

EXTRACT AND RETURN THIS JSON STRUCTURE:

RULES:
- Only include NEW milestones, actions, and elements from this response
- Do not repeat elements that were already established
- Focus on progression points: first contact, clothing removal, new positions, new sensations, climax, etc.
- Track momentum changes: building (tension increasing), peak (climactic), resolution (winding down)
- Detect if this response is repeating previous content (rehashing same scene elements, restarting scene setup, etc.)
- If repetition is detected, mark "repetition_detected": true
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
