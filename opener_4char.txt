Rachel adjusted her cocktail dress as she entered the luxurious penthouse, her eyes widening at the sight before her. Marcus, Sophia, and David were all there, each impeccably dressed and looking at her with unmistakable desire. "You made it," Marcus said, his voice deep and inviting as he stepped forward in his tailored suit. Sophia smoothed her designer dress as she moved closer, her eyes dark with anticipation. "We've been waiting for you," she purred. David, still in his business attire, poured them all drinks, his eyes never leaving Rachel's form. "You look absolutely stunning," he said, handing her a glass. Rachel could feel the sexual tension building as Marcus's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "Are you ready for what we have planned?" he asked, his breath warm against her ear. Sophia's hand joined Marcus's, both of them exploring Rachel's body through the fabric of her dress. "Let's get comfortable," David suggested, his voice rough with desire as he began unbuttoning his shirt.
