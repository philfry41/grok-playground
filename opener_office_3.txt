Jennifer adjusted her professional blouse as she entered the empty office, her heart racing with anticipation. Mr. Thompson was already there, still in his expensive suit, and Lisa was seated at the desk in her business attire. "You look beautiful," Mr. Thompson said, his voice deep and commanding as he stepped forward. Lisa smoothed her pencil skirt as she stood, her eyes dark with desire. "We've been waiting for you," she purred. Jennifer could feel the sexual tension building as Mr. Thompson's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "You've been such a good employee," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. Lisa moved to her other side, her hand gently touching Jennifer's arm. "We should reward you," Lisa suggested, her fingers tracing Jennifer's collarbone through the fabric of her blouse. Jennifer's breath caught as Mr. Thompson's other hand joined Lisa's, both of them exploring her body through her professional attire. "Let's get comfortable," Mr. Thompson suggested, his voice rough with desire.
