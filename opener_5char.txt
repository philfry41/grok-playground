Isabella smoothed her designer dress as she entered the exclusive club's VIP section, her eyes scanning the dimly lit space. James, Elena, Carlos, and Maya were already there, each dressed to impress and looking at her with hungry eyes. "You look incredible," James said, his voice deep as he stepped forward in his expensive suit. Elena adjusted her cocktail dress as she moved closer, her eyes dark with desire. "We've been waiting for you," she purred. Carlos, still in his tailored shirt and slacks, poured them all drinks, his gaze never leaving Isabella's form. "Absolutely stunning," he said, handing her a glass. Maya, in her elegant evening wear, moved to Isabella's side, her hand gently touching her arm. "Are you ready for what we have planned?" Maya asked, her voice low and intimate. Isabella could feel the sexual tension building as James's hand found her waist, pulling her closer. "Let's get comfortable," Elena suggested, her fingers tracing Isabella's collarbone through the fabric of her dress.
